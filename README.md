## Lab 9

This lab solves train motion using a fourth order runge kutta method. Includes runge_kutta_four, train_motion and moving_train. 

The solution converges at a step size of around 50 or more. To get a smoother graph with more accuracy an incresed step size is helpful. The plot will be jagged and not a smooth and continuous. I guessed at the step size until the graph looked neat. Choosing a larger step size would give more values for both position and velocity acrosss a certian time interval considering other factors such as run-time and efficiency.
