##Lab 7
This lab inclueds 3 functions: ball_motion, eullers, and falling_ball to estimate the terminal velocity for a set of three different balls of different materials. 

The curve shown by the output plot makes sense because a ball that is falling will accelerate with gravity until it reaches a terminal velocity at which its speed remains constant since it is no longer accelerating. The  general log shape curve is consistant with all of the balls since the only variation between them is their mass and radius depending on the given material. I know that my time step is "good enough" because eulers is implemented with a tolerance of 10^-6 of precision within the terminal velocity. When the time step is "too small" the terminal velocity will go on infinitely having the same value which is not necessary but it does not change the value. If the time step is too big the function will not accurately show the acceleration change leaving an innacurate result for the terminal velocity. When the time range is too short the plot looks linear since the function does not have enough time to reach the actual terminal velocity. Too long is not really an issue except with runtime and efficiency. It makes sense that the steel ball has the highest terminal velocity and the ping-pong ball the least because of the mass of the steel ball is heavier.
